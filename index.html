		<h2>What is ADHD?</h2>
		<p> ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. It is commomly diagnosed during childhood and often lasts into adulthood. Children with ADHD often have difficulty paying attention, be overly impulsive in nature, or be overly hyperactive. ADHD is considered a chronic and dibilitating disorder and is known for impacting the individual in many aspects of their everyday life, notably professional and academic achievements, social life, and daily functioning. An estimated 8.4% of children and 2.5% of adults have ADHD. Although ADHD often lasts into adulthood, ADHD presents it self differently adults and children.</p>
		
		<h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
		<p>It is normal for children to have trouble focusing from time to time. However, children with ADHD do not just simply grow out of these behaviors. The symptoms persist, can be severe, and often cause difficulty at home, school, or with friends.</p>
		<p>Behaviors of a child with ADHD might include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>trouble with temptation</li>
				<li>making careless mistakes</li>
				<li>daydreaming</li>
				<li>fidgeting often</li>
				<li>forgetfullness</li>
				<li>talking over others</li>
				<li>trouble waiting</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h2>Types</h2>
		<p>There are 3 different ways ADHD can present itself, depending on which symptoms affect the individual the most:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Inattentive: The individual has difficulty starting, organizing, and finishing tasks. They struggle to pay attention to details as well as to follow instructions or conversations. They're easily distracted and often forget parts of daily routines.</li>
				<li>Hyperactive: The individual has trouble with fidgeting and talking over others. They find it difficult to stay still. Younger children may constantly run, jump, or climb, which can often result in them hurting themselves. They may also feel anxious and have trouble with impulsivity. Meaning they may have trouble with waiting their turn, speaking at inappropriate times, or grabbing things from people.</li>
				<li>Combined: The symptoms of the previous two types equally affect the individual.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h2>Causes</h2>
		<p>Scientists and mental health professionals are still studying causes and risk factors in order to better manage and reduce cases of ADHD. The main cause of ADHD is mostly unknown but scientists are investigating possible causes in risk factors that include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Brain injury</li>
				<li>Genetics</li>
				<li>Low birth weight</li>
				<li>Alcohol or tobacco use during pregnancy</li>
				<li>Exposure to environmental risks(e.g. disease) at a young age or during pregnancy</li>
				<li>Premature delivery</li>
			</ul>
		<p>There is many speculation about the causes of ADHD (mostly from parents) that include too much sugar, too much technology, poverty, family chaos, etc. While many things, like these, may worsen symptoms, there is no scientific evidence that suggests that these are the main causes of ADHD.</p>
		
		<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
		<p>Diagnosing a person with ADHD is a process with several steps. One of the steps include a medical exam in order to rule out any other illness that share symptoms with ADHD. Most times you start by seeing a family doctor. If they think you may have ADHD, they may refer you to a clinic that can test for it. The test usually includes a checklist for rating the severity of your symptoms and taking a history of the patient from peers, family, teachers, etc.</p>
		
		<h2>Treatments</h2>
		<p>In majority of cases, ADHD is best treated with both medication and behavioral therapy. For children, it is recommended that behavioral therapy, as well as teaching the parents how to manage their child, is tried before moving to medication. The best treatment can depend on the person and the environment around them. Following up with your doctor often as well as making any changes if needed is recommended.</p>
		
		<h2>Managing Symptoms</h2>
		<p>In addition to medication and behavioral therapy, have a healthy and consistent lifestyle can make it easier for you or your child to manage ADHD symptoms. Some healthy changes that you could make include:</p>
